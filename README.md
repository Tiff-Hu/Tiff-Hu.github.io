## Academic Projects

### Bayesian Analysis on Household Dietary Diversity  

Constructed a pipeline to scrape and preprocess financial news and social media with NLP (TF-IDF, BERT
embeddings). Combined sentiment features with stock price data and trained ML models (LSTM, Random Forest)
for trend prediction. Emphasized interpretable modeling by analyzing feature importance and uncertainty in
predictions. Evaluated models with accuracy, F1, and AUC-ROC; improved performance via hyperparameter
tuning, PCA, and feature engineering.
